# Soundcloud-Desktop-App
This is an Electron based Desktop App

# Installation
If you want to run it now, you have to install npm.  
npm is included into Node.js which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  
I'm also going to package it in the future for all the people without npm.

# Credit's
[npm/node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [electron](https://electronjs.org/) for making cross platform apps so easy.
